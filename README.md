# Ecommerce StoreFront Angular2/4

My first attempt building Angular2/Angular4 app

This project was built/scaffolded by this angular 2 project generator.  All of the project build/automation/deployment tools credit goes to this lovely Angular community.

[Yeoman Angulars Fountain Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-fountain-angular2)

The ecommerce app was built using the following tools/concepts

* Components Design
* Template Property Bindings
* Services
* Routing
* Dependency Injection
* RJXS/Oservables
* Unit Testing - TODO

## Instructions to run
1. Download the source folder
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run serve`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/category`

## Instructions to test - TODO
Unfortunately, at present, I couldn't perform any unit testing for this project as there's an issue with one or two of older npm dependencies that couldn't compile any Angular components with their isolated units CSS/SASS files.  The community-scaffold project was originally designed to handle one global sass file only, but not for individual components' sass file. 

In shortly, unless I get the definite answer/fix, this issue will have to be parked until further notice.

## Extra TODOs
RXJS, Overservables, etc, etc
